    <string name="faqs">
        1. Who can give blood?\n\n\tMost people can give blood between the age of 18 to 65 and weight at least 50 kgs.\n\n\n
        2. Is it safe to donate blood?\n\n\tDonating blood is a safe process. Each donorâ€™s blood is collected through a new, sterile needle that is used once and then discarded and hence by this process you are safe from all the diseases.\n\n\n
        3. How often can I give blood?\n\n\tMale donors can can donate 4 times in 12 months with the minimum interval of 12 weeks between donations. We advise female donors to donate at an average of 16 weeks or more to reduce iron deficiency.\n\n\n
        4. How much blood will be taken at a time?\n\n\tOnly about 470 ml.\n\n\n
        5. How will giving blood affect my health?\n\n\tIf you are fit and fine, you should not experience any problems as your body makes this much blood in next 24 to 48 hrs.\n\n\n
        6. What can I do before and after giving blood?\n\n\tBe sure to eat at your regular mealtimes and drink plenty of fluids before and after donating, but avoid alcohol.\n\n\n
        7. Why can women donate less frequently than men?\n\n\tFemale donors do not have same levels of stored iron as male donors for lots of reasons. This could potentially put them at risk of anaemia and NHSBT will never risk the health of donors.\n\n\n
        8. Can I go back to work on same day?\n\n\tYes, but avoid heavy lifting, pushing or picking up heavy objects for at least an hour after donating.\n\n\n
        9. What if I feel faint when I get home?\n\n\tYou need to take it easy for a few hours after giving blood,but if you do feel faint or dizzy, lie down immediately with your legs raised. Ideally let someone else know if you are feeling unwell.\n\n\n
        10.Is it OK to give blood after tattoo, piercing or acupuncture?\n\n\tThere is always an infection risk whenever the skin is pierced. If you have had acupuncture or any complementary therapy involving penetration by needles, please wait 4 months from receiving any of these treatments.\n\t
           However, if your acupuncture was performed by NHS staff on NHS premises or was performed outside the NHS but by a qualified Health Care Professional, registered with a statutory body, then you may donate.

        \t\tFour different  people from four different backgrounds with four different personalities,
